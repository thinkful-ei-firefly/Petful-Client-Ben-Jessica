## Usage

This app allows a user to input a name and select whether they would like to be queued up to adopt a cat or a dog. Once the input is submitted, they are directed to a page displaying the current cat or dog that is at the top of the list for adoption, as well as information about it. They can also see a short list of the animals next up for adoption, as well as see their place in the waiting line and the other users waiting to adopt. The user can click to adopt the animal on the screen, in which case both the animal and the user will be removed from the queue.
